# Deep Research Test Scorecard

Results log for deep-research skill validation runs. Entries are appended automatically by `validate.sh` and manually after rubric scoring.

## How to Read This Log

Each entry records:
- **Structural validation** (from `validate.sh`): pass/warn/fail counts, word count, source count, tier distribution
- **Qualitative scoring** (from `rubric.md`): manual 4-dimension score out of 5.0

Target: All structural checks pass + rubric score ≥ 3.5 / 5.0.
