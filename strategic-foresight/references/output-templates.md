## Limitations and Caveats

[Substantive limitations — not perfunctory. Include:
- Scanning gaps (STEEP dimensions with thin evidence)
- Time horizon limitations (accuracy decreases with distance)
- Source limitations (language bias, recency bias, etc.)
- Analytical limitations (frameworks not applied, biases not fully mitigated)
- Forecast limitations (base rates unavailable, reference classes imperfect)]

## Writing Standards

### Probability Language
- **Always use specific numbers**: "65% probability" not "likely"
- **Acceptable hedging for analytical text**: "The evidence suggests..." or "On balance, this appears more probable than not (estimated 60%)..."
- **Never**: "Likely," "unlikely," "probable," "possible," "may," "could" as standalone probability statements in forecasts
- **In narrative text** (non-forecast sections): Hedging language is acceptable when clearly analytical, but always pair with specific probability in the forecast itself

### Fact vs. Inference
- **Sourced fact**: "According to [1], remote work rates in federal agencies declined to 27% by 2024"
- **Analytical inference**: "The evidence suggests that this decline reflects institutional resistance rather than worker preference, as survey data [3] shows 68% of federal employees prefer hybrid arrangements"
- **Clear signal words**: "According to [N]...", "Data from [N] shows...", "[Organization] reports..." for facts. "The evidence suggests...", "Taken together...", "This pattern indicates..." for inferences

### Section Balance
- No single section should exceed 30% of the document's total word count
- Executive summary must cover all major findings, not just the first few
- Signal map should be roughly balanced across STEEP dimensions analyzed (allow more space for dimensions with richer signals)
- Limitations section must be substantive — minimum 5% of total word count

### Scenario Narrative Standards
- Each scenario should be internally consistent (no contradictions)
- Use present tense for the scenario world ("In this future, autonomous vehicles dominate...")
- Include specific details that make the scenario vivid and testable
- End each scenario with indicators that would signal it is emerging

### Forecast Formatting
- Always use the standard format from SKILL.md Phase 3
- Probabilities must be specific numbers (not ranges — pick a point estimate)
- Base rates must be cited with source, or explicitly noted as unavailable
- Resolution criteria must be specific enough for a neutral third party to judge
