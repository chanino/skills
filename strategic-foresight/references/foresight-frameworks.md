# Foresight Frameworks Reference

## Signal Taxonomy

All horizon scanning produces signals classified into five types:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Trend** | Established pattern of change with directional momentum, supported by quantitative data | Declining US birth rate (1.64 TFR in 2023, down from 2.12 in 2007) |
| **Weak signal** | Early, ambiguous indicator of potential change — not yet a trend, may or may not develop | First municipal government adopting AI-generated legislation drafts |
| **Wild card** | Low-probability, high-impact event that would fundamentally alter the landscape | Breakthrough in room-temperature superconductivity with industrial applications |
| **Driver** | Force that shapes the direction and pace of change across multiple domains | Aging population in OECD countries |
| **Uncertainty** | Key factor whose future direction is genuinely unknown and could go multiple ways | Whether US federal AI regulation will favor innovation or precaution |

### Signal Assessment Attributes

For each signal, assess:
- **Direction**: Growing / Declining / Stable / Uncertain
- **Pace**: Fast (months) / Medium (1-3 years) / Slow (3-10+ years)
- **Confidence**: High (multiple T1/T2 sources) / Medium (mixed sources) / Low (single source or T4/T5 only)
- **Impact**: High (system-level change) / Medium (significant sectoral effect) / Low (incremental adjustment)

- Culture and values: social norms, public opinion, lifestyle changes, identity
- Workforce: skills, labor market, remote work, gig economy, automation displacement
- Health: public health trends, healthcare access, mental health, pandemics
- Equity: income inequality, access to opportunity, digital divide, social mobility

### Technological (T)
- Innovation: emerging technologies, R&D investment, patent trends, tech readiness levels
- Digital transformation: AI, automation, cloud, IoT, blockchain, quantum
- Infrastructure: broadband, energy grid, transportation, space
- Cybersecurity: threat landscape, defense capabilities, regulation
- Convergence: intersections between technologies (e.g., AI + biotech)

### Economic (E — first)
- Markets: growth patterns, sector dynamics, competition, disruption
- Trade: global trade flows, supply chains, tariffs, economic blocs
- Labor: employment, wages, skills demand, workforce composition
- Industry structure: consolidation, new entrants, platform economics, value chain shifts
- Investment: capital flows, venture capital, public spending, R&D budgets

### Environmental (E — second)
- Climate: temperature trajectories, extreme weather, tipping points
- Resources: energy, water, minerals, food security, critical materials
- Sustainability: circular economy, decarbonization, ESG, carbon pricing
- Biodiversity: ecosystem health, species loss, ocean health
- Land use: urbanization, agriculture, deforestation, land degradation

### Political (P)
- Governance: institutional strength, democratic health, state capacity

## Three Horizons Framework

Developed by Bill Sharpe and adapted for foresight. Maps the transition from the present system to a future paradigm.

### Presentation Order: H1 → H3 → H2

Present in this order because without a vision of H3, it is impossible to distinguish transformative from sustaining innovation in H2.

### H1 — Business as Usual (The Dominant System)
- What is the current paradigm? How does the system work today?
- What are its strengths? Why has it persisted?
- What signs show it is losing fitness? (declining performance, growing contradictions, mounting costs)
- What stakeholders benefit from and defend H1?
- Timeline: Present, declining over the foresight horizon

### H3 — Seeds of the Future (The New Paradigm)
- What radically different system could replace H1?
- What weak signals and niche experiments point toward H3?
- What values and assumptions underpin H3?
- What would need to change for H3 to become dominant?
- Timeline: Emerging now in niches, potentially dominant by end of foresight horizon

### H2 — The Transition Space (Innovation and Experimentation)
Critical distinction:

**H2+ (Transformative innovation)**:
- Innovations that advance toward the H3 paradigm
- Build new capabilities, create new markets, embody new values
- Example: Distributed renewable energy with peer-to-peer trading

**H2- (Sustaining innovation)**:
- Innovations that extend the life of the H1 system
- Optimize existing processes, defend incumbent positions
- Example: More efficient fossil fuel extraction

### Application Notes
- Map specific signals from Phase 1 to horizons
- Look for H2+/H2- tensions — these reveal strategic choice points
- The transition zone is where most actionable insights emerge

## Scenario Planning — 2x2 Matrix Method

The most widely practiced structured scenario method. Produces 4 (standard) or 4-6 (full mode) distinct future scenarios.

### Step 1: Select Critical Uncertainties
From Phase 2 deepening results, select the TWO uncertainties that are:
1. **Highest impact** on the foresight question
2. **Greatest genuine uncertainty** (not predictable, not already resolved)
3. **Independent of each other** (outcomes on one axis don't determine the other)

### Step 2: Define Poles
For each uncertainty, define two extreme endpoints:
- Poles should be genuinely different (not just "more" vs. "less")
- Both poles should be plausible (not one realistic and one absurd)
- Label poles with clear, descriptive names (not just "high" vs. "low")

### Step 3: Construct the Matrix
```
                    [Uncertainty 1 — Pole A]
                           |
    Scenario 1             |            Scenario 2
    [Name]                 |            [Name]
    p = XX%                |            p = XX%
                           |
[Uncertainty 2  ———————————+——————————— [Uncertainty 2
  Pole A]                  |              Pole B]
                           |
    Scenario 3             |            Scenario 4
    [Name]                 |            [Name]
    p = XX%                |            p = XX%
                           |
                    [Uncertainty 1 — Pole B]
```

### Step 4: Build Scenario Narratives
For each scenario:
1. **Name**: Memorable, evocative (e.g., "Digital Commons," "Fortress America," "Green Sprint")
2. **Narrative**: 2-3 paragraphs describing this future — what happened, how it unfolded, what the world looks like
3. **Probability**: Specific percentage. All scenarios must sum to ~100% (95-105% with rounding)
4. **Early indicators**: 2-3 observable signs that this scenario is emerging
5. **Key implications**: What this scenario means for the foresight question
6. **Winners and losers**: Who benefits and who is disadvantaged

### Step 5: Probability Assignment
- Start with equal probability (25% each for 4 scenarios)
- Adjust based on: base rates from Phase 2, current trajectory, driver strength
- Avoid anchoring on the equal-probability starting point
- Red-team each probability: "Would I bet on this?"
- Probabilities MUST be specific numbers, not vague language

### Quality Checks for Scenarios
- [ ] Each scenario is internally consistent (no contradictions)
- [ ] Scenarios are genuinely different (not variants of the same future)
- [ ] At least one scenario challenges the conventional wisdom
- [ ] Probabilities reflect evidence, not narrative appeal
- [ ] Scenarios span the outcome space (optimistic, pessimistic, and surprise)

## Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)

Developed by Sohail Inayatullah. Examines issues at four levels of depth, revealing the often-invisible assumptions that drive surface-level outcomes.

### Level 1: Litany (Surface)
- Observable data, trends, events, statistics
- "What is happening?" — the news headlines
- Source: Phase 1 scan results, deep-research baseline (if available)
- Example: "Remote work rates dropped from 58% to 27% of US workers between 2020-2024"

### Level 2: Systemic Causes (Structure)
- Social, economic, political, and institutional structures that produce the litany
- "Why is it happening?" — the systems and incentives
- Look for: economic incentives, institutional arrangements, regulatory frameworks, market structures, power dynamics
- Example: "Commercial real estate investments, management culture of in-person supervision, and tax-base concerns of cities dependent on commuter spending"

### Level 3: Worldview (Culture)
- Deeper cultural assumptions, ideological frames, and mental models
- "What do we believe about it?" — the underlying worldview
- Look for: cultural narratives, professional ideologies, generational assumptions, disciplinary biases
- Example: "The belief that physical presence equals productivity and commitment; the managerial identity tied to in-person oversight"

### Level 4: Myth/Metaphor (Deep Narrative)
- Unconscious narratives, archetypes, and metaphors that shape understanding
- "What is the deep story?" — the mythic layer
- Look for: archetypal narratives (progress, decline, renewal, fall), metaphors that frame the debate
- Example: "The office as 'temple of work' — a sacred space where real work happens; the home as place of leisure and distraction"

### Application Notes
- Interventions at different levels have different effects:
  - Litany-level: Data, policy tweaks — short-term, limited impact
  - Systemic: Structural reform — medium-term, significant impact
  - Worldview: Cultural change, reframing — long-term, transformative
  - Myth: Narrative change — deepest, slowest, most fundamental
- CLA is most valuable when stakeholders disagree about "the real problem"
- Each level can reveal different futures — a litany-level future extrapolates trends; a myth-level future reimagines the whole frame

## General Morphological Analysis (GMA)

Created by Fritz Zwicky. Structures the total set of relationships in multi-dimensional problem complexes by constructing a Zwicky box. Used in full mode only.

### Step 1: Define Dimensions
Select 3-5 key dimensions of the problem space (derived from STEEP analysis and critical uncertainties):
```
Dimension 1: [Name] — possible states: A1, A2, A3
Dimension 2: [Name] — possible states: B1, B2, B3
Dimension 3: [Name] — possible states: C1, C2
Dimension 4: [Name] — possible states: D1, D2, D3
```

### Step 2: Construct the Zwicky Box
Create a combination matrix. For 3 dimensions with 3 states each = 27 combinations. Most will be internally inconsistent or implausible.

### Step 3: Cross-Consistency Assessment
Evaluate each pair of states for consistency:
- **Compatible**: These states can coexist
- **Incompatible**: These states cannot coexist (mark with X)
- **Reinforcing**: These states actively strengthen each other (mark with +)

### Step 4: Identify Viable Configurations
From the consistent combinations, select the most contrasting viable configurations. These represent genuinely different possible futures. Aim for 3-5 configurations that span the possibility space.

### Step 5: Cross-Check
Compare GMA configurations against the 2x2 scenario matrix:
- Do they align? (Configurations map to scenarios)
- Do they reveal scenarios the 2x2 missed?
- Do they expose hidden assumptions in the 2x2 axis selection?

## Backcasting

Developed by John B. Robinson. Starts with a desirable future and works backward. Used in full mode for normative analysis.

### Step 1: Define the Desired Future State
Based on the most desirable scenario (or a stakeholder-specified goal):
- What does the world look like? Be specific and concrete
- What has been achieved? By whom?
- What metrics indicate success?

### Step 2: Identify Critical Milestones
Working backward from the desired future to today:
- **Long-range milestones** (end of time horizon - 5 years before): Major structural changes achieved
- **Medium-range milestones** (3-5 years from now): Key transitions underway
- **Near-term milestones** (1-2 years from now): First steps and early signals

### Step 3: Map Critical Path
- What must happen first? What depends on what?
- Where are the critical decision points?
- Who are the key actors at each stage?
- What resources are required?

### Step 4: Identify Enablers and Obstacles
For each milestone:
- **Enablers**: Technologies, policies, market forces, social movements that support this transition
- **Obstacles**: Institutional resistance, technological barriers, economic constraints, political opposition
- **Tipping points**: Conditions under which obstacles might suddenly fall away

### Application Notes
- Backcasting is normative — it starts from values, not just probabilities
- Best for sustainability transitions, policy design, and long-range strategic planning
- Combine with scenario planning: backcast from multiple scenarios to identify robust pathways

## Wind Tunneling

Stress-tests strategies against scenarios. Used in full mode when the query implies a decision or strategy.

### Evaluation Matrix

For each strategy being tested against each scenario:

```
| Strategy / Scenario | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Strategy A          | [Rating]  | [Rating]  | [Rating]  | [Rating]  |
| Strategy B          | [Rating]  | [Rating]  | [Rating]  | [Rating]  |
```

### Rating Scale
- **Strong**: Strategy thrives in this scenario
- **Adequate**: Strategy works with minor adjustments
- **Weak**: Strategy underperforms, needs significant adaptation
- **Fails**: Strategy is counterproductive in this scenario

### For Each Cell (strategy × scenario):
1. How does the strategy perform?
2. What adaptations would be needed?
3. What are the key vulnerabilities?
4. What would be the cost of failure?

### Synthesis
- **No-regret moves**: Actions that perform well across ALL scenarios — prioritize these
- **Big bets**: Actions that pay off strongly in some scenarios but fail in others — pursue with hedging
- **Adaptive strategies**: Actions that can be adjusted as the future unfolds — build in optionality
- **Monitor triggers**: For each big bet, specify the indicator that signals when to commit or pivot

### Application Notes
- Recommended for "exposure-heavy, irreversible choices with long payback" (capital investments, acquisitions, technology shifts, major policy decisions)
- The value is in revealing vulnerabilities, not confirming preferences
- If a strategy fails in the most probable scenario, that's a critical finding regardless of performance elsewhere
